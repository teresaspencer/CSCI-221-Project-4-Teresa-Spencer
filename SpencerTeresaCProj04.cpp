/*
Complete Practice Program #3 on page 738. You may watch video notes on this. However, no sample code is given for this project, 
as the main intent of the project is for the student to create a "project" on their own.

You are to rework Practice Program #1 from Chapter 1, page 695. You modify the Money class from Display 11.8 adding the following:

operators: <, <=, >, >=
add member function Percent (int percentFigure) const;returns a percentage of the money amount in the calling object. 
If purse is a Money object whose value is $900.00 and percentFigure is 10, you return $90.00, 10 percent of $900.00
Submit three files:

YourLastNameFirstNameInitialMoney.cpp - This file contains only the Money class implementation
YourLastNameFirstNameInitialProj4.cpp - This file contains only the main function to use/test your money class
YourLastNameFirstNameInitialMoney.h - This file contains the header file information.  
Please upload the 3 files separately on the Project 4 link. 
If you have issues uploading them separately, you can zip them into one and upload. 
The name of the zip file should be YourLastNameFirstNameInitialProj4.zip. 
The files contained in the zip file must be named as above.
